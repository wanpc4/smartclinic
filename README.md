Smartclinic is a system that holds a record of medicine in the clinic. Before this, smartclinic was not build by using django. It was build without a framework. Only used phpMyAdmin administration tool to manage MySQL database. 

Framework used for this project:
- Django (web development).

Who can use smartclinic?
Smartclinic can be used by medical officers who work at the clinic department. Doctors and nurses are eligible to use this system.

How long does it take to complete this project?
When I was an intern in web developer back then (2023), it took me 3 months to get this smartclinic project done.

What have you learned?
I have learned so many things about web development during internship. Including frontend and backend development. At first, it was so hard to understand but once I go through every tutorial, exercises, lecture videos. I completely become comfortable at it. Even after I finish my internship, I still continue to learn web development as much as I can.

Your hope to smartclinic project.
I hope that this project will be used by clinics department out there. Even not by clinic departments, I allow anyone to use this project's source code as a purpose of learning (not plagiarism!).
